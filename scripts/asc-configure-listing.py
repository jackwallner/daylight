REVIEW_NOTES = """Daylight Left reads the HealthKit timeInDaylight type only. It never writes to Apple Health.

TO TEST WITHOUT HEALTH DATA: complete onboarding and open Today. The screen works with no Apple Health samples at all. It shows how much daylight is left before sunset, today's sunrise and sunset, the day length, and the latest time you could head out to reach your daily target. Only the "minutes spent in daylight" figure needs Health data.

TIME IN DAYLIGHT is recorded by Apple Watch using its ambient light sensor. A reviewer testing on iPhone alone will see zero minutes spent, and the app says so explicitly rather than implying the user stayed indoors.

PERMISSIONS: onboarding asks for HealthKit read access and, separately, one approximate location fix. Both are skippable. Location is used only to compute sunrise and sunset on device. No location or health data leaves the device, and there is no background location tracking.

NO ACCOUNT IS REQUIRED. There is no login, ad network, or server storing anything.

TODAY IS FREE. Daylight remaining, the sunrise and sunset times, the daily target, the head-out-by time, source controls, widgets, complications, and seven days of history all work with no purchase.

DAYLIGHT+ is an optional monthly or yearly subscription, each with a 7-day free trial for eligible customers, or a one-time lifetime purchase. It adds history past seven days, the month-over-month daylight comparison, and a reminder before the daily deadline.

Sunrise and sunset are astronomical calculations. Minutes in daylight are reported from Apple Health. The app does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent anything, and makes no claim about mood, vitamin D, sleep, or eyesight."""
